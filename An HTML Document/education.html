            <h2>Golden West College</h2>
            <p>After I moved to the US, I went to Golden West College. Golden West College was a great college.<br>
            I was doing Chemical Engineering, and then I hated Chemistry. So, I decided to move to Mechanical Engineering.<br>
            I loved Physics and Math, and I took all my undergraduate requirements to transfer to a University in Golden<br>
            West College (GWC).<br></p>

            <p>My favorite course at GWC is Physics Based Calculus Mechanics (PHYS G185). This is the class that got me interested<br>
            in doing my Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering.<br></p>

            <aside>
                <p>After finishing up my finals, I reserved a study room in GWC Library and got drunk with my friends<br>
                who were happy that they finished their finals as well.<br></p>

            <h2>University of California Irvine</h2>
            <p>After finishing up from GWC, I moved to UC Irvine for school to complete my major in Mechanical Engineering.<br>
            I loved Control Systems and Embedded Systems, so I decided to specialize in Controls and Embedded Systems.<br>
            Finally, in 2018, I finished my Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering with a specialization in Controls<br>
            and Embedded Systems from UC Irvine.<br></p>

            <p>My favorite course at UC Irvine is Vibration. This class was a very hard class, and I learned from it a lot<br>
            because it really prepared me for Controls System, which was the class after Vibration.<br></p>

            <aside>
                <p>The day I graduated and walked during my graduation ceremony was the best memorable memory I had at UC Irvine.<br></p>

            <h2>Stevens Institute of Technology</h2>
            <p>After finishing up my Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering, I started working as an Avionics and Electrical<br>
            Engineer at The Boeing Company. After 3 years from working, I decided to get my Master Degree in Computer Science from<br>
            Stevens Instiute of Technology. I loved the Computer Science Program at Stevens. Although it was a wild ride to study with<br>
            work, however, I really learned from the CS Program at Stevens, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to get into Computer<br>
            Science or Software Engineering.<br></p>

            <p>My favorite course at Stevens is Web Programming I because I learned a lot from it. Although it was a lot of material to<br>
            take in, the class was very organized, and the videos were very helpful, and it taught me great material for Web Programming.<br></p>

            <aside>
                <p>One of the memorable memory that I had at Stevens is when I got an A in Cloud Computing. It was a hard class, and I thought<br>
                I am going to get a B, and it is going to ruin my GPA. However, I did really good in the last few assignments, and I ended up with<br>
                an A in this course.</p>
