    <h1>My Horrific Story About My Macbook</h1>
    <main>
        <p>Back in 2018, I went to buy a Macbook laptop for school. I went with my friend, and I went to the<br>
        Apple Store. Macbook are usually expensive, and I saved some money during college to buy a Mac.<br>
        After buying my Mac, I was so happy and me and my friend went to starbucks in the mall. After coming<br>
        back from Starbucks, I went home.<br></p>

        <p>Once I got home I was not able to find my Mac, and I freaked out. I contacted my friend to see if he has it<br>
        and he did not have it. After an hour from searching, I remebered that when we were leaving back home<br>
        I placed the Macbook on the top of my car to open the car door, and I forgot my Mac on the top of my car.<br>
        I went back to the place where I parked. I remember I parked next to the street. I saw my Mac on the street<br>
        and many cars already drove on it. It was literally in pieces.<br>
