            <h2>Where I Was Born</h2>
            <p>My name is Georges Hatem, and I was born in Lebanon. I did my high school there and moved to the US for college. <br>
            I wanted to become a pilot, and I also loved Architecture and Engineering. I did really good in my Calculus and <br>
            Physics courses in high school. In Lebanon, we have to take Physics, Biology, and Chemistry from Grade 7 until Grade 12. <br>
            This is the reason why I was very good in Physics, Biology, and Chemistry when I moved to the US. Also, we start taking <br>
            Calculus in Grade 9 and up. So, I was really good in Math as well for this reason. <br>
            </p>
            <p>In Lebanon, we have to take official exams in Grade 9 and Grade 12. If we fail the official exams in Grade 9 or Grade 12 <br>
            we will fail Grade 9 or Grade 12 respectively and we will have to repeat the whole year again. Even if we pass our midterms <br>
            and finals in school, we will still fail and have to repeat the whole year again if we fail the official exam. I used to study <br>
            so hard for our official exams so that I can do good and pass my grade. The pass grade back in Lebanon was 10/20, which means that <br>
            it was 50 percent and above for passing, however, we had around 12 materials per year, and it was a year system as well.<br>
